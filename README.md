# React Refresher (Tic Tac Toe)
> Implementing extra features to the react tic tac toe tutorial..

In order to give myself a refresher using react, I followed the tutorial on their official page in order to implement a working tic tac toe.<br>
At the end of the tutorial, they had 7 tasks to implement by yourself which I will be attempting to do.
<br>

## Tasks
I will be implementing these features!

- Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
